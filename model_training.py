"""
Model Training

This script trains a RandomForestRegressor model on the processed dataset.
It performs the following steps:
1. Loads the processed dataset.
2. Selects relevant features and target variable.
3. Splits data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
4. Trains a Random Forest model.
5. Evaluates model performance using MAE and RÂ² Score.
6. Saves the trained model for later use.

Usage:
    Run this script after feature engineering to train and evaluate the model.
